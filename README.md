### Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm Chris Straffon, a full time DevOps Engineer/Team Lead. But in my spare time I like to geek out and contribute to open source projects focussing around my Solar Panel setup. Most notably the [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) and [PyPi_GrowattServer](https://github.com/indykoning/PyPi_GrowattServer) repos
